Based on REACTJS, NODEJS, and connected with MongoDB

This is based on Reactjs and NODEJS with the help of MongoDB. 
I created a search bar where I can use filters which means which are connected with every name of the elements whenever we search on the search bar we get that particular item or similar themes OR items.
